People always talk about
Hey oh hey oh hey oh
All the things there all about
Hey oh hey oh hey oh
Write it on a piece of paper
Got a feeling now see you later

There's something bout me
Let's keep it moving
And if it's good lets just get something cooking
Cus I really wanna rock with you
I'm feeling some connection to the things you do
（You do, you do）

I don't know what it is
That makes me feel like this
I don't know who you are
But you must be some kind of superstar
Cus you got all eyes on you no matter where you are
You just make me wanna play
```

Bad boys on there best behaviour

There's something bout you
Let's keep it moving
And if it's good lets just get something cooking
Cus I really wanna rock with you
I'm feeling some connection to the things you do
（You do, you do）

I don't know what it is
That makes me feel like this
I don't know who you are
